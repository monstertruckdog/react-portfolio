                    My name is Bryan Civils and I'm from Raleigh, North Carolina.
                    Over the years I've worked as an audio/visual installation technician,
                    inside and outside Sales for a manufacturing sales representative company and application
                    support for a healthcare SaaS company.  But since I've started in my
                    current role as Software Test Engineer, I've found that I have an
                    unending curiosity and joy learning about software development, it's processes,
                    and tools.  To further improve upon my on-the-job training I'm currently enrolled
                    in the UNC Full-Stack Developer coding bootcamp and hope to graduate in 2021.
